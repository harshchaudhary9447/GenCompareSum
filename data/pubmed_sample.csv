 backgroundalthough familial susceptibility to glioma is known , the genetic basis for this susceptibility remains unidentified in the majority of glioma - specific families . 
 an alternative approach to identifying such genes is to examine cancer pedigrees , which include glioma as one of several cancer phenotypes , to determine whether common chromosomal modifications might account for the familial aggregation of glioma and other cancers.methodsgermline rearrangements in 146 glioma families ( from the gliogene consortium ; http://www.gliogene.org/ ) were examined using multiplex ligation - dependent probe amplification . 
 these families all had at least 2 verified glioma cases and a third reported or verified glioma case in the same family or 2 glioma cases in the family with at least one family member affected with melanoma , colon , or breast cancer.the genomic areas covering tp53 , cdkn2a , mlh1 , and msh2 were selected because these genes have been previously reported to be associated with cancer pedigrees known to include glioma.resultswe detected a single structural rearrangement , a deletion of exons 1 - 6 in msh2 , in the proband of one family with 3 cases with glioma and one relative with colon cancer.conclusionslarge deletions and duplications are rare events in familial glioma cases , even in families with a strong family history of cancers that may be involved in known cancer syndromes .
